## 1.2 Use R to answer the following.
## 1.2.1 Create a vector (using {c()}) called {a} (i.e. assign it to an 
##       object called {a}) with four elements which are the integers 
##       5 to 8 (inclusive).

## 1.2.2 Display element 2 of {a}.

## 1.2.3 Display element 4 of {a}.

## 1.2.4 Calculate the product of elements 2 and 4 of {a}.

## 1.2.5 Assign the integers 3 and 4 to object {b} and use {b} to select elements 3 and 4 of object {a}.

## 1.2.6 Display every element of {a} except element 2. 

## 1.2.7 Display every element of {a} except elements 3 and 4. 

## 1.2.8 Display only those elements of {a} that are greater than or equal to 6.

## 1.2.9 Display only those elements of {a} that are not equal to 7.

## 1.2.10 Use the {list} function to create an object {ab} which is a list of the two objects {a} and {b}.

## 1.2.11 Display {ab}.

## 1.2.12 Change the names of the elements in {ab} to ``a'' and ``b''.

## 1.2.13 Display {ab} again. What has changed?

## 1.2.14 Create this matrix {m}:
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, byrow=T)
m
## Why are the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in the first row and not the first column? 

## 1.2.15 Display the element on the second row and second column of {m}.

## 1.2.16 item Display only the 2nd row of {m}.

## 1.2.17 Display only the 3rd column of {m}.

## 1.2.18 Display only the 2nd and 3rd columns of {m}. Do so in two different ways.
