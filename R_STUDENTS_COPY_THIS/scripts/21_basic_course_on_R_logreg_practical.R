## Basic Course on R:
## Logistic Regression
## (Practical)

## 1. Read in the data R_data_January2015.csv with a header and row names from the first column. 
## Assign it to the object babydata and allow strings be converted to factors. 
## Attach the data to the environment.

## 2. We would like to know if smoking predicts Status.
## Since Status is a binary variable (intellectual disability or normal brain development) we need to use logistic regression.
## Answer the following questions:
  
  ## 2(a) Write down the model with logit(p), ln(p/(1-p)), on the lefthand side, but instead of writing p write P(intellectual disability). 
  ## Then write down the formula for this probability (the probabilty of having a baby with intellectual disability).

  ## 2(b)  If we run the model on the data as it is now, R will consider "normal brain development" as the event because it is second in the levels of Status:
  levels(Status)
  ## So we need to first change these factor levels so we treat "intellectual disability" as the event. Run the following trick: 
  table(Status)
  newstatus <- factor(3-as.numeric(Status),labels=c("normal brain development", "intellectual disability"))
  ## And to show that it worked:
  levels(newstatus)
  table(newstatus)

  ## 2(c) Now run the regression model you set up above in R using newstatus. 
  ## Then write down the model and probability of event with the estimates.

  ## 2(d) Can smoking significantly predict newstatus? [Hint: use summary.]
  
  ## 2(e) What is the probability of having a baby with an intellectual disability given the mother smokes?
  
  ## 2(f) Our estimate of b_1 is the element in the 2nd row and 1st column of the coefficients from the summary call. 
  ## What is the value of e^{b_1}? [Hint: use exp.]
  
  ## 2(g) Is the e^{b_1} that you just calculated an odds ratio? 
  ## How do you interpret it?
  
  ## 2(h) What do you think e^{b_1} would have been if we didn't change the levels of Status? 
  ## Re-run the model using Status to check your answer. 
  ## How does it relate to your answer from (f)? 
  
  ## 2(i) There is another way to calculate an odds ratio without using logistic regression. 
  ## Suppose we have the following 2x2 contingency table:
  matrix(c("a", "c", "b", "d"), ncol = 2)
  ## then the odds ratio is (a*d)/(b*c). 
  ## Create a contingency table of smoking and newstatus [Hint: use table] and then calculate the odds ratio from that. 
  ## Do you get the same answer as in (f)? 

## 3. We would like to know if smoking and vitaminB12 can be used to predict newstatus. Answer the following questions:

  ## 3(a) Set up (i.e. write down) the logit model and run it in R. 
  ## Write the model with the estimates.

  ## 3(b) Can either variable significantly predict Status?

  ## 3(c) What is the probability of having a baby with an intellectual disability given the mother smokes and has a vitaminB12 level of 400? 
  ## What is the probability of having a baby with an intellectual disability given the mother smokes and has a vitaminB12 level of 650?
