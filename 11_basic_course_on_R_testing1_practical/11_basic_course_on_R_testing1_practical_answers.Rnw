\begin{enumerate}[{1.}]
\item Read in the data ``R\_data\_January2015.csv'' with a header and row names from the first column. Assign it to the object {\tt babydata} and allow strings be converted to factors. Attach the data to the environment.
{\color{red}
<<>>=
babydata <- read.csv("R_data_January2015.csv", header = T,row.names = 1)
attach(babydata)
@
}
\item What are the dimensions of {\tt babydata}? What is the class? Answer these questions separately with two functions and then together with one function.
{\color{red}
<<>>=
dim(babydata)
class(babydata)
str(babydata)
@
}
\item Answer the following questions pertaining to the variable {\tt SAH}:
  \begin{enumerate}
\item What are the 20\% quantiles of {\tt SAH}?
{\color{red}
<<>>=
quantile(SAH,seq(0,1,.2))
@
}
\item What are the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of {\tt SAH}?
{\color{red}
<<>>=
summary(SAH)
## or
mean(SAH)
median(SAH)
vs <- var(SAH)
vs
sqrt(vs)
@
}
\item Create a stem and leaf plot of {\tt SAH}. 
{\color{red}
<<>>=
stem(SAH)
@
}
\item Create a histogram and a horizontal boxplot of {\tt SAH} in one graphics window where the plot of the histogram is above the boxplot. 
\begin{center}  
{\color{red}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(SAH)
boxplot(SAH,horizontal=TRUE)
@
}
\end{center}

\item Utilize all 3 graphs to describe the shape of the distribution of {\tt SAH}.\\

{\color{red} The distribution is unimodal and slightly skewed to the right}.

\item Log-transform SAH (assign it to {\tt logSAH}).
{\color{red}
<<>>=
logSAH <- log(SAH)
@
}
\item What are the 20\% quantiles of {\tt logSAH}?
{\color{red}
<<>>=
quantile(logSAH,seq(0,1,.2))
@
}
\item What are the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of {\tt logSAH}?
{\color{red}
<<>>=
summary(logSAH)
## or
mean(logSAH)
median(logSAH)
vls <- var(logSAH)
vls
sqrt(vls)
@
}
\item Create a stem and leaf plot of {\tt logSAH}. 
{\color{red}
<<>>=
stem(logSAH)
@
}
\item Create a histogram and a horizontal boxplot of {\tt logSAH} in one graphics window where the plot of the histogram above the boxplot. 
\begin{center}  
{\color{red}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(logSAH)
boxplot(logSAH,horizontal=TRUE)
@
}
\end{center}  

\item Utilize all 3 graphs to describe the shape of the distribution of {\tt logSAH}.\\ 
{\color{red} The distribution is unimodal, symmetric and appears normal.}

\item What did the log transformation do to the values of {\tt SAH}?\\ 
{\color{red} Dampened the effect of skewness to make the distribution more normal and symmetric.}

\item Take a random sample of size 50 from {\tt logSAH} and make a histogram. Does this distribution have a similar shape compared to that of all {\tt logSAH} values?
\begin{center}  
{\color{red}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
set.seed(1234)
hist(sample(logSAH, 50))
@
}
\end{center}   

{\color{red}
The distribution looks somewhat similar to that of the complete data.
}

\item Take a random sample of size 50 with replacement from {\tt logSAH} and make a histogram. Does this distribution have a similar shape compared to that of all {\tt logSAH} values?
\begin{center}  
{\color{red}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
set.seed(1234)
hist(sample(logSAH, 50, replace=T))
@
}
\end{center}  

{\color{red} The distribution looks quite different from the original distribution.}
\end{enumerate}

\item Answer the following questions pertaining to the variable {\tt medication}: 
  \begin{enumerate}
\item Use a function to create frequency table of the number of mothers taking medication and not taking medication.
{\color{red}
<<>>=
table(medication)
@
}
\item Calculate the percent of the mothers are taking medication; what is the percentage?
{\color{red}
<<>>=
table(medication)/length(medication)
@   
}
\end{enumerate}

So 16.3\% of mothers are taking medication.

\item Answer the following questions pertaining to the variable {\tt educational\_level}: 
  \begin{enumerate}
\item Create a frequency table of the number of mothers in each education level.
{\color{red}
<<>>=
table(educational_level)
@
}
\item Create a horizontal boxplot of the {\tt SAH} values for the different levels of education and color each box a different color. Add a rug plot of the values where the ticks for each group have the same color as their corresponding box. 
\begin{center}
{\color{red}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
boxplot(SAH ~ educational_level, horizontal=TRUE, 
        col=c("purple","orange","green"))
rug(SAH[educational_level=="low"], col="green")
rug(SAH[educational_level=="intermediate"], col="orange")
rug(SAH[educational_level=="high"], col="purple")
@
}
\end{center}

\item Are {\tt triglycerides} normally distributed (make a plot to answer this question)? If not, log-transform them. Are the log-transformed values normal? 
\begin{center}
{\color{red}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(triglycerides)
hist(log(triglycerides))
@
}
\end{center}

{\color{red} The values are skewed to the right and are still skewed after a log transformation.       
}

\item Is the average triglyceride level for highly educated mothers different from that of mothers with a low education level? Formulate a hypothesis, test it, and make a decision about whether or not you can reject the null hypothesis. Can you use a $t$-test (either on the raw or log-transformed data)? Why or why not (hint: how are the data distributed)?\\

{\color{red} We cannot use the $t$-test because the data are not normally distributed, even after a log transformation! However, since the shapes of the distributions are similar, as evidence by the below plot, we can perform a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. 
\begin{center}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
trigly_high <- triglycerides[educational_level=="high"]
trigly_low <- triglycerides[educational_level=="low"]
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(trigly_high, main = "high")
hist(trigly_low, main = "low")
@
\end{center}
 Our null hypothesis is that the difference in location between the low and high education levels is 0. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference. 
<<>>=
wilcox.test(trigly_high, trigly_low)
@
 The $p$-value is not less than 0.05 so we fail to reject the null and conclude that we do not have enough evidence to show a statistically significant difference between the centers of the high and low mothers' triglycerides.
}
\item Now re-do the test and make your decision to reject/not reject the null based on the confidence interval. Challenge: extract the confidence interval from the test output and use logical operators to answer the question of whether the interval contains the null value. 
{\color{red}
<<>>=
wtest <- wilcox.test(trigly_high, trigly_low, conf.int=TRUE)
ciw <- wtest$conf.int
0 > ciw[1] & 0 < ciw[2]
@

Since the confidence interval contains 0, we fail to reject the null.   
}
\end{enumerate}


\item Answer the following questions pertaining to the variable {\tt Status}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are the average {\tt SAH} values for the two levels of {\tt Status} (normal brain development or intellectual disability) different? Formulate a hypothesis, test it, and make a decision about whether or not you can reject the null hyopthesis. Can you use a $t$-test (either on the raw or log-transformed data)? Why or why not (hint: check distributions with plots)?\\
{\color{red}
 We can use the $t$-test on the log-transformed data, since they are normally distributed, as shown in the plots below.
\begin{center}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
sah_m <- SAH[Status=="intellectual disability"]
sah_n <- SAH[Status=="normal brain development"]
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(sah_m, main = "intellectual disability")
hist(sah_n, main = "normal brain development")
hist(log(sah_m), main = "intellectual disability")
hist(log(sah_n), main = "normal brain development")
@
\end{center}
 Our null hypothesis is that the difference in mean {\tt SAH} between the two groups is 0. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in means. 
<<>>=
sstest <- t.test(log(SAH)~Status)
sstest
sstest$p.value
sstest$conf.int
@
 The $p$-value is less than 0.05 (and 0 is not in the CI) so we can reject the null hypothesis that the difference in means between the two groups is 0. We conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the average log-{\tt SAH} of mothers with intellectually disabled children and the average log-{\tt SAH} of those women whose children have normal brain development. 
}      
      \item What is the fold change of log-{\tt SAH} between the 2 groups? Calculate it two ways: use the output from the previous test and also use the data itself (function {\tt mean} plus logical operators). 
{\color{red}
<<>>=
sstest$estimate[2]/sstest$estimate[1]
mean(log(SAH)[Status=="normal brain development"])/
  mean(log(SAH)[Status=="intellectual disability"])
@
}      
      \item Make a boxplot of the {\tt SAH} values of the 2 groups and calculate the fold change of {\tt SAH} between the 2 groups. Does the difference seem clinically relevant? Why or why not? 
{\color{red}
\begin{center}
<<out.width="3.2in">>=
boxplot(SAH ~ Status)
mean(SAH[Status=="normal brain development"])/
  mean(SAH[Status=="intellectual disability"])
@
\end{center}

The fold change is really close to one and there is actually quite a bit of overlap in the boxplots. The statistically significant difference of the log-transformed data is quite subtle and may not be relevant, though further investigation of confounding factors may elucidate the true relationship between {\tt SAH} and brain development.
