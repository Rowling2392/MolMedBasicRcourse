\newpage\section{Basic Plotting}

\subsection{Use {\tt R} to do the following exercises on the {\tt BOD} data.}  

\begin{enumerate}[{1.1}.1]
 \item Display the built-in dataset called {\tt BOD} by running {\tt BOD}.
 \vspace{5 mm}
 \item What is the data structure of {\tt BOD}? What are the dimensions?
 \vspace{10 mm}
 \item What are the names of {\tt BOD}? Use a function other than {\tt str}.
 \vspace{10 mm}
 \item Make a line graph of demand versus time, where the line is a deep pink dot-dashed line [Hint: run {\tt ?par} and look for the parameter {\tt lty} to see the line types]. Add a blue dashed line of 1.1 times the demand and give it a thickness of 2 using the line width parameter {\tt lwd}. Make sure both lines are entirely visible by adjusting the range of y using the parameter {\tt ylim} in the original plot.

\subsection{Use {\tt R} to do the following exercises on the {\tt chickwts} data.}  


\begin{enumerate}[{1.2}.1]
 \item Display the built-in {\tt chickwts} data.
 \item What is the data structure of {\tt chickwts}? What are the
   dimensions?
 \vspace{10 mm}
 \item What are the names of {\tt chickwts}? Use a function other than
   {\tt str}.
 \vspace{10 mm}
 \item What are the levels of {\tt feed}?
 \vspace{10 mm}
 \item Make the following plots in one 2 x 2 image:
   \begin{itemize}
     \item A bar chart of the feed types, each bar a different color.  
     \item A bar chart of the proportions of feed types, each bar a
       different color.
     \item A boxplot of the weights by feed type, each box a different
       color.
     \item A horizontal boxplot of the weights by feed type, each box
       a different color.
   \end{itemize}
 \vspace{10 mm}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Use {\tt R} to do the following exercises on the {\tt Puromycin} data.}  


\begin{enumerate}[{1.3}.1]
\item Display the built-in {\tt Puromycin} data.
\item Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the
  concentration. Describe the relationship.
  \vspace{20 mm}
\item Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the
  concentration. Describe the relationship.
  \vspace{20 mm}
\item Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the
  concentration and color the points by treatment group ({\tt
    state}). Describe what you see.
  \vspace{20 mm}
\item Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the
  concentration, color the points by treatment group ({\tt state}),
  label the x-axis ``Concentration'' and the y-axis ``Rate'', and
  label the plot ``Puromycin''.
  \vspace{5 mm}
\item Add a legend to the above plot indicating what the points
  represent.
  \vspace{5 mm}
\item Make a boxplot of the treated versus untreated rates. Using the
  function {\tt pdf}, save the image to a file with a width and height
  of 7 inches.
  \vspace{5 mm}
\item Make a histogram of the frequency of concentrations. What is the
  width of the bins?
  \vspace{10 mm}
\item Make a histogram of the frequency of concentrations with a bin
  width of 0.10. How is this different from the histogram above?
  \vspace{20 mm}
\item Plot the histograms side by side in the same graphic window and
  make sure they have the same range on the y-axis. Does this make it
  easier to answer the question of how the two histograms differ?
